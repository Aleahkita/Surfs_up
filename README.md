# Surfs_up

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to analyze weather data to complete a business plan for opening a Surf and Shake shop in Oahu. The investor requested analysis on temperatures for the months of June and December to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business will be sustainable year-round. 


## Results

Key differences between June and December:

- There is a difference in mean temperature by about 4 degrees with temperatures still in the 70s. 
- The minimum temperature in June is 64 degrees and 56 degrees in December.
- The maximum temperature in June is 85 degrees and 83 degrees in December.


## Summary
When assessing temperatures in the months of June and December there were 1700 and 1517 observations respectively. The mean temperature was 74.9 degrees in June and 71.0 degrees in December. These temperatures bode well for the success of the proposed Surf and Shake shop. 

Additional queries could look at precipitation in the two months as well to get a good idea of weather conditions. 

The first is a query to extract precipitation observations for the month of June.
